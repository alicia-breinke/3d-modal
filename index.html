  <h1>About Guiding Lights</h1>
  <p>This is a project that was inspired by the grueling exodus of Yeonmi Park after she fled North Korea in hope of a better future.  My intention was to trace some of her journey through dangerous regions, such as mountains and the Mongolian Desert, before arriving in South Korea.  I also wanted to represent the guidance of the North Star and other cosmic objects, which provided guidance during this ambiguous time in her life.</p>
